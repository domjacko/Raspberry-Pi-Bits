RPi-Bluetooth-Searcher
======================

A Bluetooth Searcher program for use with the Raspberry Pi.

To use this program you will need:

  * Raspberry Pi
  * Bluetooth Dongle
  * Breadboard, Jumper Wires, Resistors and 2 x LED's

You will also need to ensure the `RPi.GPIO` Python package is installed as well as the `bluez` bluetooth manager and the `python-bluez` package.

Here is my [blog post](http://domjacko.wordpress.com/2014/08/05/bluetooth-phone-searcher-with-leds/) about the program.
